[00:36.55] Hold on, hold on, fuck that
[00:40.10] Fuck that shit
[00:43.05] Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again
[00:46.32] Wait a minute
[00:47.62] Fuck that shit
[00:49.45] Still on this motherfuckin' record
[00:53.05] I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all
[00:56.10] Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
[00:57.76] I'll sound a whole lot better
[01:16.19] Listen
[01:18.31] Seeing you got ritualistic
[01:22.62] Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
[01:26.05] 'Cause I'm fallin' apart
[01:32.50] Yeah, tension
[01:35.44] Between us just like picket fences
[01:39.74] You got issues that I won't mention for now
[01:43.25] 'Cause we're fallin' apart
[01:50.46] Passionate from miles away
[01:53.66] Passive with the things you say
[01:56.92] Passin' up on my old ways
[01:59.05] I can't blame you, no, no
[02:07.58] Passionate from miles away
[02:10.82] Passive with the things you say
[02:14.04] Passin' up on my old ways
[02:16.15] I can't blame you, no, no
[02:41.90] Listen
[02:44.05] Harder buildin' trust from a distance
[02:48.31] I think we should rule out commitment for now
[02:51.81] 'Cause we're fallin' apart
[02:59.06] Leavin'
[03:01.20] You're just doing that to get even
[03:05.45] Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
[03:08.95] They keep fallin' apart
[03:16.20] Passionate from miles away
[03:19.36] Passive with the things you say
[03:22.60] Passin' up on my old ways
[03:24.77] I can't blame you, no, no
[03:33.32] Passionate from miles away
[03:36.51] Passive with the things you say
[03:39.72] Passin' up on my old ways
[03:41.91] I can't blame you, no, no
[04:09.17] Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
